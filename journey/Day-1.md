**Understanding Databases:**

In the realm of computing, a database (or "DB") is like a digital warehouse where information is stored, organized, and easily retrievable. Imagine it as a virtual filing cabinet that helps you manage and access data efficiently.

**Creating a Database:**

Creating a database in MongoDB is as easy as pie. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
> use mydatabase
```

Replace "mydatabase" with the desired name of your database. MongoDB will create it for you on the fly!

**Removing a Database:**

If you need to bid farewell to a database, the process is straightforward. In the MongoDB shell, type:

```bash
> use mydatabase
> db.dropDatabase()
```

This command deletes the currently selected database, so be cautious!

**Viewing Databases:**

To view the databases available, use:

```bash
> show dbs
```

This command displays a list of all databases on your MongoDB server.
